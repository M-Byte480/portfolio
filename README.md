# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website source code.  
The purpose of this website to show off all my projects and skills in a central location.

## About the portfolio
This portfolio is made using Angular 6, and is currently being hosted on my University's Computer Society's server undert the domain
[milan.users.skynet.ie](https://www.milan.users.skynet.ie/) 

As of today, there are three pages:
- The **about** page which acts as both my home and introduction about myself.
- The **blogs** page where I waffle about things I find interesting.
- The **projects** page where I show off my projects.

There is a [project](https://github.com/users/M-Byte480/projects/1/views/1) page on GitHub where you can view the progress of the features and tasks which I need to complete.

## Goal
There is two primary goals for this portfolio:
- To expand my knowledge of Angular
- To show off my skills and projects
