            My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-kovacs-cs/" class="linkedIn"
                          target="_blank">Milan Kovacs</a> currently studying <a
            href="https://www.ul.ie/courses/bachelor-science-computer-systems" class="linkedIn"
            target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.ul.ie/" class="linkedIn"
                                                           target="_blank">University of Limerick</a>.
            Born in Hungary and moved to Ireland back in 2013. Was introduced to programming with
            Python
            in 2017 and been coding ever since.

          <p class="paragraph">
            The concept of Object-Oriented Programming was introduced to me in college via Java, and I
            have been refining its semantics and behaviour ever since. Beside Java, in college I had
            touched on Lua, C, C++, SQL, HTML and CSS. Throughout it I had used these languages both
            for
            assignments and personal projects, which all can be found on my <a
            href="https://github.com/M-Byte480" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            Part of my course was to partake in a cooperative work-placement to learn first-hand about
            the industry. The company I ended up working with was <a href="https://www.gm.com/"
                                                                     target="_blank">General
            Motors</a>,
            where I was shown what I have learnt from college in-action but knowledge beyond it. I was
            introduced to the Agile methodology, and the importance of teamwork and communication.
            <br>

            Most of my time was spent working on a fullstack application using <a
            href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a>, <a
            href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> and <a
            href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>. Was introduced to a
            vast
            array of tools and technologies, <i> such as Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, GitHub, Insomnia,
            PgAdmin, etc. </i> We were following Scrum framework where we would plan out our delivery
            goals biweekly, have daily stand-ups and reflect on the progress.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            While developing the application, I was exposed to networking, security and databases.
            Personally found the high-level overview and designing of it to be the most interesting.
            Once I had a strong understanding of what problem it solved, it was much easier to
            navigate
            and implement features.
