        The concept of Object-Oriented Programming was introduced to me in college via Java, and I have been refining its semantics and behaviour ever since. Beside Java, in college I had touched on Lua, C, C++, SQL, HTML and CSS. Throughout it I had used these languages both for assignments and personal projects, which all can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/M-Byte480" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page.
