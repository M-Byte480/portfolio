description
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) module for the 2nd year of my course, where we were taught about the basics of data structures and algorithms, and my solutions done in C++.

DSA was an interesting module which I enjoyed. In this module we had covered the Big O notation for the time complexity of algorithms.
The data structures we covered were: Heap, Binary Search Tree, Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Trees.


We learned about the analysis of algorithms, and how do identify their time complexity.
The main algorithms we covered were: Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Binary Search, Linear Search.


As of today, I have expanded on my knowledge and other data structures such as Hash Tables, Graphs, Queues, Deques, etc. Other search algorithms such as Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, etc.
