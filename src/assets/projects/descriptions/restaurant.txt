description
A centralized management system for a restaurant chain, with a focus on the back-end. Dynamically manage the restaurant states, via a login system and storing the system state within CSV files.
Group project done by Tadhg Ryan, Brendan Quinn, Stephen Fitzpatrick and myself.
The goal was the create and simulate the back-end of a restaurant management system.


It had to include and meet the following requirements:


ul
Be able to create a restaurant
Manage bookings
Manage tables
Manage staff
Manage menu
Manage orders
Manage payments
View income between two dates
/ul

Our project had a boot up system, and it would check if its the first time booting up.
If it was, it would create the owner account and you (the owner) be able to create a restaurant, add managers, manage menus
and be able to see income between two dates.
