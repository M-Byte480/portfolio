Highest Prime number under a given number, in a prefix notation language called Racket.

This was my first 'big' project in Uni. I had a passion for maths and physics and prime-numbers have always interested me.
Whenever I wanted to learn a new language, a prime number checker/finder was always my first project.


Racket is a functional programming language, with a different syntax to most other languages, with prefix notation.
I really enjoyed making it, getting to grips with the syntax and the functional programming paradigm.


Because Racket is old it uses certain low level functions and you had to come up with clever ways to get around it.
