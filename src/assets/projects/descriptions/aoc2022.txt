Advent of Code, the opportunity to learn new languages, new concepts while still having fun.

Since 2021, I have been partaking in the Advent of Code challenge. Each year I learn and train my problem-solving to solve new puzzles.

So far, this is what this repository contains:
ul
2021 - Python
2022 - Java
2023 - Java
/ul

It is a great journey, and looking forward to attempting previous years' and get a grasp on Rust.
