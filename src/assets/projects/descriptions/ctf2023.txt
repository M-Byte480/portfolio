Came accross an ad for a Capture The Flag (CTF) event hosted by <a href="https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/home.action">Reply Cyber Security Challenge</a> and decided
to give it a go with my friends <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/euan-bourke/">Euan Bourke</a>,

I have done one CTF before with my work placement company back in June of 2023. It was a lot of fun, did well and learned a lot.
In contrast to that CTF, this one was a lot more difficult. We were able to solve 2 problems, but it was a great learning experience.
There was cryptography problems using RSA, website based problems where you had to use networking solutions to get the flag,
and reverse engineering problems. Had to use Ghidra to reverse engineer a binary file and find the flag.

One of my favourite problems involved an audio file that had text hidden inside it.
Using a program called Audacity, we were able to see the text hidden inside the audio file when viewing the audio file as a spectrogram.
