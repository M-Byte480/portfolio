Plain Spring-Boot application setup from scratch

During work-placement I worked on a full stack project for internal uses.
It used Angular for the front-end, Spring Boot for the back-end and PostgreSQL for the database.
It has inspired me to try and setup a SpringBoot application from the ground up.


Looking forward to enhance and expand from this, as this is just the foundations to get an API up and running.
